#Project description
This repository gathers three discord bots created for the discord server "La camara de los secretos", which is the community server of the chilean school "Deutsche Schule Sankt Thomas Morus". 
<br/>
The aim of this markdown is then to show the commands that these bots support, in case some fellow classmate needs the code for some reason. 
<br/>

#KnowledgeController
This first bot was created in order to make the server more user-friendly. That is to say, it is a support bot that has many help commands.
